The open office text document there is partial (no figures).
The word document is more complete, so start from this.

Decide to use the "filtered web page" format form word to strip out most tags.
Lots of consequences of going to HTML, e.g., pictures move around and all equations become uneditable.  I think we can live with this for the sake of making editing easy.
